# Code Review of ORB-SLAM2
**Reviewers:** NLS Lab. from Shanghai Jiao Tong University

**ORB-SLAM**
[ORB-SLAM2](http://webdiis.unizar.es/~raulmur/orbslam/) is a classic SLAM library and has demonstrated high robustness and versatility in both indoor and outdoor environments. It has become a golden example for SLAM and Robotic researchers to study and have good usderstanding of the architecture of the SLAM systems.

This code review gives more detailed and standardized comments for most of important lines in [original ORB-SLAM codes](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2). Most of comments are annotated in Chinese.
